# Welcome to Juliar.Future Project

I would like to thank you for contributing to the *Juliar * Project.
The aim of this project is to build a fully functional compiler 
for *Juliar * Programming language that will compile for use in JVM
Machine.

Here are some helpful guidelines for contributing:

## The *Juliar * Communtiy
Have an idea or a big feature. Please make sure to post it in our forums
at https://www.juliar.org/forums . Make sure that you have gotten a reply
before implementing something that can change the language.

## Documentation
Anybody is free to fix the documentation. The Documentation is one of
the harder part of the project. It's hard to write it and it's even 
harder to maintain. If you can help with that, it will be really appreciated
Make sure to post any big changes on the forums to get some feedback.

## Testing
Most of the testing will be automated. However, there is no substitute
for a human being. The testing is probably harder than coding. 
If you find a bug, make sure to put it into bugs section in github.
Also, if you would like feedback, please post the bugs in the forums.


## Coding & Submitting to Github
Keep the code clean by following K.I.S.S. principle. 
If you want to make a major change, just fork the project, update it,
and once you've fully implemented the fix, submit a pull request to
the main project.
